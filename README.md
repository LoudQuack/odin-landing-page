# Odin Landing Page Website
This project aims to demonstrate some skills about HMTL & CSS that i've learned through "The Odin Project". It's also my 2nd project and not optimized for small devices such as smartphones, tablets, etc...
Notice that I don't know anything about structuring the code, so it's a complete mess. But anyways, what is important for now is that it works.
The images may long a bit to load depending on your connection (i use "lorem pic").
